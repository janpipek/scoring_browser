{"name":"Scoring browser","tagline":"Simple Qt4 & Python application for browsing scoring outputs in Geant4","body":"This program enables you to browse mesh data created in Geant4\r\nusing macro-based scoring (/score/...).\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n* 2D tables along any axes\r\n* absolute vs. relative values\r\n* colour background (white - red - black)\r\n* export of 2D tables to CSV\r\n* simple statistics display for cells\r\n* reduction in any dimension if the data table is too detailed\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n* python (2.7 or 3.2)\r\n* PyQt4\r\n* numpy\r\n\r\nProgram has been tested on a Linux machine and on Windows (a while ago).\r\nIt should be platform-independent.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n    python main.pyw\r\n    python main.pyw datafile\r\n\r\nI believe that the DataMatrix class can be used on its own.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n-------\r\n11 Jun 2013 - Few changes that make the program easier to work with but no new features.\r\n\r\n01 Feb 2012 - I had a scoring file which I had to visualize quickly its contents but there\r\n\twas no simple way how to do it. So I started with this project.\r\n\t\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\nI'd be happy to accept feature requests, cooperation, questions, bug reports...\r\nPlease write to jan.pipek AT gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
